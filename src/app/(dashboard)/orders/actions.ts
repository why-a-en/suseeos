 * The list can't page by navigation: a new `?cursor=` would *replace* the
 * rendered page rather than extend it, and the point of loading more is to
 * keep what's already on screen (and the scroll position that goes with it).
 * So the first page is rendered by the route from searchParams, and every
 * page after it comes through here and is appended client-side.
 *
 * The filters arrive from the client rather than being re-derived here,
 * which is safe: they only ever narrow, and `fetchOrdersPage` scopes to the
 * caller's organization through `withCurrentOrganization` (with RLS behind
 * it) no matter what is passed in. A tampered filter can hide rows from the
 * person doing the tampering; it can't reach another org's.
