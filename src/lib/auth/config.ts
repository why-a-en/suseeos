// Explicit BETTER_AUTH_URL wins; on Vercel, Production gets the stable
// production domain and every other environment gets a URL that actually
// points back at itself, so a deploy works without hardcoding anything.

// src/lib/auth — so baseURL only matters for the library's own internal
// URL building, not for browser CSRF/redirects.)

// VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL is *always* set, on every environment —
// it's "the production domain," not "this deployment's domain" — so using
// it unconditionally would resolve a Preview deployment's baseURL to
// production. Gate it on actually being Production; everywhere else,
// VERCEL_BRANCH_URL (stable per git branch) beats VERCEL_URL (unique per
// deployment, reshuffles on every push). Mirrors appBaseURL() (src/lib/app-url.ts).
