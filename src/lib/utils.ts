/**
 * The standard shadcn/ui helper — merges Tailwind classes so later ones win
 * over earlier conflicting ones instead of just concatenating.
 *
 * Extended with this project's own scales, which is load-bearing rather than
 * cosmetic. tailwind-merge resolves conflicts from a built-in table of class
 * groups; it has no idea `text-label` is a font size here, so it filed it
 * under *colour* and let the next `text-*` win. Any component that set a size
 * and a colour through one `cn()` call — `cn("text-label", "text-text-muted")`
 * — therefore lost its size silently and inherited whatever the parent used.
 * Badge rendered its 10px mono micro-label at 15px body size for exactly this
 * reason. Declaring the scales here fixes every such pairing at once.
 *
 * Same reasoning covers `ease`: without it, `cn("ease-standard", "ease-spring")`
 * — Button's tactile-easing override — would keep both classes (tailwind-merge
 * has no idea they're the same CSS property) and let source order in the
 * compiled stylesheet decide the winner instead of the later argument, which
 * is exactly the kind of silent, hard-to-notice bug the font-size one was.
