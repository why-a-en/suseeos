// 16 runs Proxy on the Node.js runtime by default, so a DB call would work
// here now — this split is for separation of concerns, not a runtime
// limitation.)

// Deliberately does NOT bounce an already-logged-in visitor away from
// /login — that used to live here, keyed on cookie presence, and it caused
// a real redirect loop: a *stale* cookie (present, but no longer matching
// a session — e.g. after a DB reset) is "logged in" by this cheap check
// but not by requireUser()'s real one, so the two sides disagreed and
// bounced the browser between / and /login forever. The login page does
// that bounce itself now, using the same real check requireUser() uses, so
// there's exactly one source of truth for "is this session actually
// valid" instead of two that can disagree.
