/** The system is monochrome, so press is *felt*, not coloured: primary opens
 *  a soft ring under the cursor (--ring-soft) and widens its own tracking a
 *  hair on hover, and every variant scales down fractionally when pressed.
 *  None of that needs JS state — :hover/:active/:disabled cover it natively,
 *  which also makes press register on touch (the mouse-event-only version
 *  this replaces never did).
 *
 *  Primary/danger — the buttons that make something happen — deepen that
 *  scale a touch further via `tactile` below. (A vibration and a ripple
 *  effect both briefly lived here too and were pulled: the vibration read
 *  as unnecessary buzz nobody asked for, and the ripple read as a stray
 *  flash rather than an intentional effect. Neither was the actual "feels
 *  physical" lever — the press/release scale below is.)
 *
 *  The press-in and release use DIFFERENT easing, deliberately: pressing in
 *  is `ease-standard` (a plain decelerate, no overshoot) so the button
 *  visually registers the tap immediately — a spring's overshoot wobbles
 *  before settling, which reads as hesitation exactly when speed matters
 *  most. `ease-spring` is reserved for releasing back to rest, where the
 *  little bounce is what makes it feel physical rather than robotic and
 *  nobody's waiting on it. This works because a CSS transition's timing
 *  function is read from the rule for the state being transitioned *to* —
 *  `active:ease-standard` governs entering `:active`, the plain `ease-spring`
 *  on the base class governs leaving it.
 *
 *  `disabled:pointer-events-none` is load-bearing beyond the cursor: it also
 *  suppresses every hover rule below, so a disabled button can't light up.
 *
 *  NOTE: `npx shadcn add <anything>` will overwrite this file back to stock —
 *  it treats button as a dependency of several components. If a shadcn add
 *  reports "Updated: button.tsx", restore this before committing. */
