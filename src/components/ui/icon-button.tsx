/** An icon-only tap target — TopBar actions, sheet close buttons.
 *
 *  A thin wrapper over Button's `icon-*` sizes rather than a second button
 *  implementation (it used to be one, with its own hover, focus ring and
 *  disabled handling that drifted from Button's). Two things justify the
 *  wrapper over calling `<Button size="icon">` directly:
 *
 *  - `label` is REQUIRED and becomes the accessible name. A control with no
 *    text is invisible to assistive tech otherwise, and a plain Button can't
 *    make that mandatory at the type level.
 *  - `href` renders a real `<Link>`. Every navigating call site had wrapped
 *    this in one, producing `<a><button></button></a>` — invalid HTML that
 *    announces two nested controls.
 *
 *  `variant` maps onto Button's: solid → the bordered chrome used for a
 *  TopBar's primary action, ghost → everything else.
 *
 *  `href` renders via `<Button asChild>` — Slot merges Button's own props
 *  onto the `<Link>` beneath. (A ripple effect briefly lived in this branch
 *  as a hand-rolled `<Link>` on `buttonVariants`, since Slot can't inject a
 *  ripple span alongside a single child — pulled along with ripple itself;
 *  see button.tsx.) */
