/** The shared chrome behind every full-bleed list row (CustomerRow,
 *  ProductRow, OrderItemRow, the Orders log).
 *
 *  Composed on the registry's `Item` via `asChild`, which is what lets the
 *  row render as the *right element* — the part that kept going wrong when
 *  each row hand-rolled it. A row that navigates renders a real `<Link>`; a
 *  row that runs a handler renders a real `<button>`; a row that is only a
 *  readout stays a `<div>`. Previously every interactive row was a
 *  `<div onClick>` — unreachable by keyboard and invisible to assistive tech
 *  — and the one list that genuinely navigated worked around that by
 *  wrapping the row in a `<Link>` and passing `onClick={() => {}}` purely to
 *  light up the hover state.
 *
 *  Item's own look (rounded card, `border-border`, `bg-accent/50` on hover)
 *  is overridden throughout: rows here run edge to edge with a hairline
 *  underneath, which is the list rhythm this app uses everywhere.
 *
 *  Pass one of `href` / `onClick`, never both — a row is either a
 *  destination or an action, and nesting a button inside an anchor is
 *  invalid HTML. `href` wins if both arrive, so a stray handler can't
 *  produce that nesting. */
